# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Integrate MagicUI's FlickeringGrid component into the OpusClip clone video editing platform frontend to enhance UI/UX with dynamic visual effects across the entire landing page.

## Key Knowledge
- Technology stack: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Component library: shadcn UI with MagicUI registry integration
- MagicUI components are added via `npx shadcn@latest add @magicui/[component-name]`
- FlickeringGrid component location: `src/components/ui/flickering-grid.tsx`
- The project already had MagicUI registry configured in `components.json`
- Main page already implements FlickeringGrid as background effect with color "#8A5D96"
- Z-index management is critical for layering: grid should be at `z-[-1]` to appear behind content
- Project uses a custom color scheme with soft lilac background (#E2CFE8) and deep purple accents (#4B1D5C)

## Recent Actions
- Successfully added @magicui/flickering-grid component using shadcn CLI
- Created comprehensive documentation files:
  - MAGICUI_FLICKERING_GRID_USAGE.md (usage guide with examples)
  - MAGICUI_COMPONENTS.md (instructions for adding more MagicUI components)
- Created demo components showcasing different FlickeringGrid implementations
- Updated README.md to include MagicUI information and usage instructions
- Verified component integration by confirming it's already active in the main page
- Optimized implementation by removing duplicate FlickeringGrid component from page (keeping only in layout)
- Removed unused FlickeringGrid import from page component
- Confirmed proper z-index layering with grid at `z-[-1]` and content at `z-10`
